                            After witnessing the financial struggles of many families in my community post-COVID, I initiated a program to provide free meals to families in need. I founded Ramadan Respite, a project aimed at providing free meals to people in unfortunate situations. I coordinated approx. 25 volunteers (varies day to day) to cook, donate or drive and gathered lists of people in need from multiple community organizations. I played the central role in this program to connect these groups while maintaining people’s privacy. Every year, Ramadan Respite helps 500+ individuals in need, stretching across the entirety of the Durham Region.

                            In my community, many people were losing essential skills such as interactive communication, especially after the Covid Pandemic. I wished to engage the youth by inviting them to interact with each other, attend various workshops and provide support to the local community. I founded Durham’s Connect, an organization dedicated to engaging youth across the GTA. I organized sports tournaments, culturally diverse events and invited famous motivational guest speakers. I partnered up with other non-profit organizations such as Islamic Relief, Durham’s Athletics and Toronto’s Linkup to create diverse and inclusive environments.

                            The importance of teaching robotics to STEM passionate kids and supporting women in engineering, helping to promote diversity, inclusivity and innovation in STEM fields were all key points of motivation for me to start an informative and intensive summer robotics camp. I started the first annual robotics summer camp in my community, open to 7-9th grade boys, girls and PLP students. I invited sponsors, purchased Arduino kits, created lesson plans and designed hands-on projects. The camp provides motivational foundations to the world of robotics and introduces 50+ kids to embedded system programming!

                            Every human deserves a chance to learn. I view PLP kids as gifted individuals with special skills and unique potential. My school recognized my ability to interact with these kids and offered me a PLP supervisor job. I visit the PLP classrooms during my lunch hour and spend my time addressing each particular student's needs. This job brought a new perspective to my life and taught me patience, compassion, and understanding. The skills I gained from this job have allowed me to advocate for PLP students and provide an inclusive and fostering learning environment whenever I have a chance.

It warmed my heart to see these kids succeed and be able to move on in life. I will save no effort to continue passing the knowledge I gain to others to help them better realize their strengths and reach their full potential!
