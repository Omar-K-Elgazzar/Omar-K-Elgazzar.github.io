                            Diversity is what makes Canada strong. As a Muslim, my responsibility is to spread peace and promote equity and inclusivity in my community. I joined my school's Muslim Student Association to promote understanding, raise awareness of the Islamic culture, build cross-religion bridges, and cultivate a sense of belonging to new Muslim students. As the president, I served the needs of 200+ Muslim students and facilitated social engagement in safe and accommodating environments. With my team, the MSA successfully ran a plethora of events and global-issue fundraisers, including our yearly Ramadan Iftar, Relief for the Middle East Crisis fundraiser and our international Hijab Day events!

                            I believe I was born with a STEM instinct. I built robots as young as 8 years old. I established (or helped to flourish) robotics clubs in all my previous schools in Canada and the USA. High school was no exception. As president of my schools robotics club, I strive to design and create complex and challenging objects. As well, myself and my team engage in a plethora of competitions, including the Ontario Tech Sumo Bot Challenge and the Alamein International Robotics Championship in Egypt. Working with my team, I have gained extraordinary skills in the art of robotics and formed a lasting bond with my team that will persist for years to come.

                            As my school's student council leadership minister, I strive to cultivate an environment that fosters creativity and nurtures personal and professional development. I organized leadership training workshops and fundraising events to raise awareness for global issues. I orchestrated with other clubs to organize cultural days. I established events to welcome, orient, and integrate the 9th graders into high school society. I communicated with students from all grades to better connect with the student body. I am grateful that I was able to sharpen my communication skills, demonstrate leadership by example, voice our students' concerns, and serve our school community.

I joined my school's construction SHSM program, where I learned about the trades and construction. Our team was tasked to design and build a goat shelter for the Oshawa Zoo. My creative eco-friendly design won first place and I led the team in building and installing the project. The design considered several factors for the goats to exhibit natural behavior such as comfort, safety, and the visitors' viewing experience. I am glad that I was able to benefit my community.

                            I have always been interested in the way politics work and the art of debate. I joined my schoolâ€™s Model UN and fell in love with it. I learned how to speak eloquently, how to structure my arguments and how to respect others and their views. I became a Model UN executive and began organizing club meetings and conferences. I debated, gave speeches, provided tips on how to debate in confidence, and teamed up to advertise Model UN. Overall, Model UN has helped me to gain higher confidence, become a better person, and encourage others to reach their full potential.
